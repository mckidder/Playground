# Parallel Programming: MPI Dependency Graph and Output Server

Simple program that takes a graph as input from a file and then
performs a parallel topilogical traversal using vertex dependencies.

The program then sends the results to an output server so that they
are not jumbled.

run "make" and then "make run" to execute.


Three graph*.txt files included for various graph testing.
