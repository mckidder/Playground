// Delete method from the puzzle with these five parameters, and then
// return the identity of the worker. The receive must be called with
// MPI_ANY_SOURCE for the source. The identity of the worker can be
// found in status.MPI_SOURCE. You can either send/receive an array of
// 5 integers, or use 5 messages, but make sure that they come from
// the same process, meaning that after you get the id from the first
// message, you must use that as the source in the other receive
// messages. A size of 0 should mean that the word was not found in
// the grid. The function should return the identity of the process it
// has received the result from.
